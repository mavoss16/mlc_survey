3. Family events for just the church community (I love our international ministry, but we need time to connect as a community)
4. Bible studies and other community activities at times when people with full-time jobs can attend
5. Ministries which are run by, and integrated into the church, and not solely run by staff members
6. Collaboration between existing church leadership and younger church members to run programming, IT, international ministries, church maintenance, organ maintenance, etc
7. Visibility for the whole church membership of what it takes to run the church
8. Church involvement might be better done through more than just an annual survey. Maybe a yearly ""involvement"" fair or something. This would also help make how the church runs more visible to the membership.

A concern I have, having been through significant changes at other churches is to ensure our church runs on a strong community (which builds and participates in programs) and not programs which people are encouraged to participate in.

It might be a good idea to do background checks on the people who teach the kids."

I would like to see us support our pastors and current ministries, create another position that can take a lead in Sunday School / youth / confirmation / family ministry. Let's take a leap. Not a partial leap. But a full leap.","Sunday School Programming,Young Family Programming,Bible Studies,Other (please explain)",Community building,"50-59 ","Over 20 years ","I'm a little torn on some of my answers (I don't believe I have it all figured-out. I trust the wisdom of those who know more) and honestly, I'm tired of some of these questions. I've been at Memorial long enough to know that these surveys come out, I answer them, or I participate in small group discussions, and the results fall flat. We've lacked the leadership to actually make changes. I want you to know I am praying for you. I pray the board can prayerfully move forward and make changes that benefit the church as a whole.

Community: I long for community. I come to church faithfully for over 30 years. And yet, I do not feel like there is anyone I could call if I had an emergency aside from the pastors. I don't want to switch churches/denominations just to have friends. I'd like to see the church take a hard look at how to successfully build a vibrant church community. 


Pastors: I think we ask a lot of our pastors. I actually think we ask too much of them. That's why I'd like to see us hire another full time employee. Let's boldly ask God to help us grow ministries beyond our vision.

I feel like we have a tendency NOT to spend money if there's a way we can get by. And while I appreciate the desire to use the gifts of people in the church -- I think people are just so busy. Tired. And honestly, possibly feeling inadequate to do whatever it being asked. We have biblically-illiterate members -- as a whole. It would make sense that people don't feel educated enough to teach or lead. Think about it, we value the education our pastors and other church workers go through before receiving calls, but when it come to parishioners, we want them to take leadership roles trusting that they have enough biblical / Lutheran heritage knowledge to do so. But maybe they don't. That seems like an unfair request. I'm sure if people felt confident, they'd love to share their skills and knowledge.

Related to focus: In my time at Memorial, I've gotten the feeling that we, as a governing whole, think if we put more effort or focus into a certain group of our church, the others will fail. Kind of as though God is limiting our ministries and somehow we get to decide who is most deserving. That seems a little off to me. I think God has the ability to bless as many ministries as he sees fit. To say we need to focus on one ministry, does not take away from the other ministries. I would never want to take away the student ministries. I would never want to take away the international ministries. But let's not be afraid to address the others. Our mission is everywhere to everyone. We need to watch and listen and pray and faithfully act. "

Remind people of parking options on busy Sundays.  Engage with those not attending or unable to attend.  Important to have college fellowship to keep them strong in their faith with friends or bring them to the faith.  Important to have international ministry and classes because these people are in Ames and the university even if for a short time.  Important to support and pray for missions that have a connection to Memorial. Encourage daily Bible reading, devotions, prayer at home.  Grow in our faith so that we can serve and share it in different ways.  Encourage the young adults just starting out, engage with retirees moving here and attending."
